# 10MinuteMail Public Project

While I am not currently open sourcing the 10MinuteMail application code, I have created this project to initially provide issue tracking for bugs or enhancement requests - https://github.com/devondragon/10MinuteMailPublic/issues

All of the transaltion localization files here, so the community can help improve existing and add new transalations via PRs.

Thanks!!

P.S. - Check out the Beta of the next-gen 10MinuteMail here - https://beta.10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/
